## Workflow Management/Engines
* [Airflow](https://github.com/airbnb/airflow) - "Use airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed."
* [Azkaban](https://azkaban.github.io/) - "a batch workflow job scheduler created at LinkedIn to run Hadoop jobs. Azkaban resolves the ordering through job dependencies and provides an easy to use web user interface to maintain and track your workflows."
* [Dray.it](http://dray.it/) - "Docker workflow engine. Allows users to separate a workflow into discrete steps each to be handled by a single container."
* [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) - "a Python module that helps you build complex pipelines of batch jobs. It handles dependency resolution, workflow management, visualization etc. It also comes with Hadoop support built in."
* [Pinball](https://github.com/pinterest/pinball) - "a scalable workflow management platform developed at Pinterest. It is built based on layered approach."
* [TaskFlow](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/TaskFlow) - "allows the creation of lightweight task objects and/or functions that are combined together into flows (aka: workflows) in a declarative manner. It includes engines for running these flows in a manner that can be stopped, resumed, and safely reverted."
* [Toil](https://toil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Similar to Luigi, jobs are classes with a run method. Supports executing jobs on other machines (workers) which can include AWS spot instances.

## Job Scheduling

* [Dagobah](https://github.com/thieman/dagobah) - "a simple dependency-based job scheduler written in Python. Dagobah allows you to schedule periodic jobs using Cron syntax. Each job then kicks off a series of tasks (subprocesses) in an order defined by a dependency graph you can easily draw with click-and-drag in the web interface."
* [JAMS Scheduler](http://www.jamsscheduler.com/) - "JAMS is an enterprise job scheduling and workload automation solution."

* [PETL](https://github.com/alimanfoo/petl) - "a general purpose Python package for extracting, transforming and loading tables of data." Slower than Pandas and not as good for larger amounts of data, but simpler.
* [PyQuery](https://pythonhosted.org/pyquery/) - Extracts data from web pages with a jquery-like syntax.
* [Retrying](https://github.com/rholder/retrying) - Allows you to add a decorator to any function/method to retry on an exception.

## ETL Tools (GUI)
*Warning*: If you're already familiar with a scripting language, GUI ETL tools are not a good replacement for a well structured application written with a scripting language. These tools lack flexibility and are a good example of the ["inner-platform effect"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner-platform_effect). With a large project, you will most likely run into instances where "the tool doesn't do that" and end up implementing something hacky with a script run by the GUI ETL tool. Also, the GUI can conceal complexity and the files these tools generate are impossible to code review. However, the GUI and out-of-the-box functionality can make some tasks simpler, especially for people not comfortable with writing code.
